# Wordle
[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) is a word game, where you are given 5 guesses to guess a 5 letter word. Every guess you make, you are told whether the letters are in the word and the correct place, in the word but in the wrong place or not in the word at all. This is my Python verion of it!
